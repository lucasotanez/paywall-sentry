## :package: Installation
> intended for the Google Chrome browser

- Navigate to [Paywall Sentry](replaceWithPsLink) on the Chrome web store
- Or navigate to the [extension store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions)
and search for "Paywall Sentry"
- Click "Add to Chrome"
- That's it! The extension will automatically detect search results that require
subscriptions and warn you accordingly.

## :heavy_plus_sign: Configuration
If you have active subscriptions for certain websites that may be flagged by Paywall
Sentry, you can add them in the extension options:

- Click the extensions icon in the top righ of your browser (the puzzle piece icon)
- Click the three dots next to Paywall Sentry
- Select "Options"
- In the options page, you can enter the base url of any subscriptions you may have. <br>
For example, if you own a Chegg subscription, you would input "www.chegg.com" (without quotes)
- Now, search results that contain the url you specified will not be flagged.
