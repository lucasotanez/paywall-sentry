<h1 align="center"> üîç Paywall Sentry üîç</h3>

<p align="center">A lightweight browser extension that offers helpful highlighting on 
Google search results which contain content locked behind paywalls or subscription fees. 
Save time and avoid clicking on unhelpful links. üîí</p>

## :package: Installation
> intended for the Google Chrome browser

- Navigate to [Paywall Sentry](replaceWithPsLink) on the Chrome web store
- Or navigate to the [extension store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions)
and search for "Paywall Sentry"
- Click "Add to Chrome"
- That's it! The extension will automatically detect search results that require
subscriptions and warn you accordingly.

## :zap: Usage
The extension detects and flags all paywalled sites out of the box. There are 2 classes
of paywalls:
### Soft Paywalls
> Denoted by a **[‚ùó]** icon and a *yellow* link color. Soft paywalls allow
free use for a limited time. For example a news outlet with a soft paywall may allow users
to read 5 free articles before demanding a subscription:

<p align="center" style="color:#a6ab1f">[‚ùó] This is an example of a link to a site with a soft paywall.</p>

### Hard Paywalls
> Denoted by a **[‚úò]** icon and a *red* link color. Hard paywalls are stricter
than soft paywalls and do not allow any access without a subscription.

<p align="center" style="color:#d11919">[‚úò] This is an example of a link to a site with a hard paywall.</p>

In either case, Paywall Sentry still allows users to click on these links. The warnings 
are intended to suggest that clicking on a certain search result is likely a waste of
time (unless you are considering buying a subscription to a given site, in which case you
should see [Configuration](#configuration) below to unmark that site).

## :v: Configuration
If you have active subscriptions for certain websites that may be flagged by Paywall
Sentry, you can add them in the extension options:

- Click the extensions icon in the top right of your browser (the puzzle piece icon)
- Click the three dots next to Paywall Sentry
- Select "Options"
- In the options page, you can enter the base url of any subscriptions you may have. <br>
For example, if you own a Chegg subscription, you would input "www.chegg.com" (without quotes):
- Now, search results that contain the url you specified will not be flagged.
